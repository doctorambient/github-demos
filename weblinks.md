# Epidemiology and Disease Modeling Links
Just some links for reference!

## R Epidemics Consortium
A working group in Europe collecting R programming resources for modeling epidemiology and disease outbreaks. All open source and open access. Some of the notes are just presentation slides so not always useful without a lot of background knowledge.

## COVID Epidemiology Models in R
Several blogs are available, often originating from the overall blog [R Views](https://rviews.rstudio.com/). (Note: Don't confuse this with the R task views system; they are unrelated!)
